**nustracker** is a desktop application for NUS event directors and student leaders of student organizations in NUS School of Computing to manage students and events.

As an event director/student leader, you will be able to add students and events into **nustracker** and use it to keep track of which students are attending which event, and even blacklist students from certain events. These are just some of the features, and there will be even more coming in the future. **nustracker** is also customized to your needs, and is simple, intuitive and easy to pick up.

All these things can be done through a simple and intuitive Command Line Interface (CLI), while being complimented by a detailed and elegant application. This document will guide you through on how to start using **nustracker**.

      student ID `e1283011`, year `2`, phone number `81231293`, and email `johndoe@example.com` to nustracker.
   
   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.


6. For a full and comprehensive overview of each command, refer to the [Feature](#features) section!

**Now, you are ready for an unprecedented overhaul in student and event management using nustracker!**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

nustracker was designed to help the average overworked university student, who also has many important responsibilities outside the curriculum
in clubs and societies—specifically **student and event management**.


### What can nustracker do?
1. **Keep track of students**

    nustracker displays all students currently associated with the organization neatly. The students have their details
   and a profile picture (optional) listed with them as well, allowing quick and convenient access to student particulars.


2. **Keep tracks of events and event _attendance_**

    nustracker can also display the events stored, their information, and the participants taking part in those events.


4. **Keep track of event blacklists**
    
    Events often have blacklists, which can also be tracked within nustracker.


5. **Be customized to the user's liking**
    
    One of the key points of nustracker is its customization. For more information, see [Customization](#customization).


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [m/MAJOR]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/CS` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[y/YEAR]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `y/1`, `y/ 1 2 3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `students`, `events`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* However, commands that take in parameters cannot contain extraneous prefixes nor slashes.

* This means none of the input parameters should contain any slashes, since slashes are used to identify prefixes.

* If a command is entered with the correct prefixes but multiple inputs to the prefixes are not accepted, 
the error message shown would be based on the leftmost invalid prefix parameter in the command's command format.

<br><br>

### Listing all students: `students`

Shows all students in nustracker.

This command essentially removes any filters that have been applied with the `filter` command.

Command: `students`
<br><br>

### Editing a student : `edit`

Edits an existing student in nustracker.

Command: `edit id/ID_OF_STUDENT_TO_EDIT [n/NEW_NAME] [m/NEW_MAJOR] [id/NEW_STUDENT_ID] [y/NEW_YEAR] [p/NEW_PHONE] [e/NEW_EMAIL]`

* Edits the student who currently has the specified `STUDENT_ID`.
* **At least one of the optional fields** must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Events of a student cannot be directly edited with the `edit` command, the `enroll` and `remove` commands serve this purpose.

Examples:
* `edit id/e0322322 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email of the student with student ID `e0322322` to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

<br><br>
 
### Deleting a student : `delete`

Deletes the specified student from nustracker.

Command: `delete id/STUDENT_ID`

* Deletes the student with the specified `STUDENT_ID`.

Examples:
* `delete id/e1234567` deletes the student with the student ID `e1234567`.
* `delete id/e0589162` deletes the student with the student ID `e0589162`.

_**Note**_: 
The command to delete both students and events are `delete`.
<br>
However, `delete` will only delete either a student or an event and 
**cannot contain both student and event prefixes at once**.
<br>
I.e. `delete id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT_NAME` is not allowed. 
(Refer to "Deleting an event" for more information.)
<br><br>

### Filtering students: `filter`

Filters students whose data contains the given field, the search is case-insensitive.

Command: `filter [id/STUDENT_ID [MORE_STUDENT_IDs]...] [n/STUDENT_NAME [MORE_STUDENT_NAMES]...] [m/MAJOR [MORE_MAJORS]...] [y/YEAR [MORE_YEARS]...] [ev/EVENT_NAME]`

* You can filter by:
    - Multiple student IDs.
    - Multiple student names.
    - Multiple majors.
    - Multiple years.
    - **A single** event name.

* You can only filter by one field (i.e. filter only by student ID, student name, year, major, or event name).
* You have to filter by at least 1 parameter (simply typing `filter` will not work)
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `n/john` will match with `n/JOHN`.
* You can search using multiple keywords except for events.
* You can search by partial keywords for names. e.g. `n/al` will match with `n/alice`

Examples:
* `filter id/e1234567` returns the student with the ID e1234567 if that student exists in nustracker.
* `filter id/e1234567 e2345678` returns two students whose student IDs are e1234567 and e2345678 if they exist in nustracker.
* `filter n/John` returns the students whose names contain John.

* `filter m/CS IS` returns the students majoring in CS or IS.
* `filter y/1 2 3` returns the students in years 1, 2, or 3.
* `filter ev/orientation` returns a list of students who are tagged to the Orientation event.

_**Coming soon:** Filter by phone number._

_**Coming soon:** Filter by multiple fields._

<br><br>

### Delete shown students : `delfiltered`

Mass deletes all students currently shown in the student list. This is typically used after a filter
command to delete students based on a certain criteria.

Command: `delfiltered`

* This command can only be used when nustracker is showing the Student list.
* Use with caution! If the student list is not filtered before using `delfiltered`, all the students currently in
  nustracker would be deleted since all of them are shown.
* After all the filtered students are deleted, the remaining students would then all be shown in the list, if any.
* At least one student needs to be shown in the filtered list for `delfiltered` to work.

Examples:
* `filter y/4` followed by `delfiltered` will delete all students who are in Year 4, possibly because they are graduating soon.
* `filter ev/Graduation 2021` followed by `delfiltered` will delete all students that have attended the Graduation Ceremony in 2021.

<br><br>

### Blacklisting students: `blacklist`

Blacklists students from the given event by student ID. Blacklisted student IDs will not be allowed to enroll into the event.

Command: `blacklist id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Student ID need not exist in the database.
* Event name has to exist in the database.

Examples:
* `blacklist id/e1234567 ev/Orientation Camp` blacklists the student ID e1234567 from the Orientation Camp event.
* `blacklist id/e0000000 ev/Sports Camp` blacklists the student ID e0000000 from the Sports Camp event.

<br><br>

### Whitelisting students: `whitelist`

Whitelists students from the given event by student ID. Whitelisted student IDs are removed from the event's blacklist.

Command: `whitelist id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Student ID needs to be in the event's blacklist.
* Event name has to exist in the database.

Examples:
* `whitelist id/e1234567 ev/Orientation Camp` removes the student ID e1234567 from the Orientation Camp event's blacklist.
* `whitelist id/e0000000 ev/Sports Camp` removes the student ID e0000000 from the Sports Camp event's blacklist.

## Customization

Another key feature of nustracker is its ability to be customized greatly. This section covers how nustracker can be
customized to your liking.

### 1. Changing between Light/Dark Theme
nustracker has a light/dark theme. To toggle between the two, either type `refresh` or click the button (to the left of **Settings**) as shown in the image below and voila!
 
![change_theme](images/change_theme.PNG)

### 2. Setting a profile picture
nustracker has the ability to add a profile picture to a student. Follow the steps given to add a picture:

1. If you have not started nustracker before, run nustracker within a folder of your choice.

2. Once it runs, a folder called _**profile-pictures**_ is created within the folder that contains nustracker.

    ![profile-pictures-folder](images/profile-pictures-folder.PNG)

    *The **profile-pictures** folder is highlighted in blue*

<br>

3. Open the _**profile-pictures**_ folder and add the image you want as a profile picture. The image must be either a **.png** or a **.jpg** image.

4. <br>

   1. Rename the image to correspond to the **Student ID** of the student in nustracker that will use this profile picture.

       For example, let's say there is a student in nustracker with the Student ID **e1111111**.

      ![match-student-id](images/match-student-id.PNG)
 
      ![changed-profile-picture](images/changed-profile-picture.PNG)

      *The updated student card (belonging to student with Student ID **e1111111** in nustracker)*
      <br><br>
   3. The image will update once you **type `refresh`, click the Refresh button, or restart nustracker**.
   4. You're done!

### 3. Changing the _glow_ of the profile picture border

nustracker allows you to change the color of the glow of the profile picture.

1. Open up the **Settings** window either by clicking the **Settings** button or by typing in `settings` into the command box.
 

2. Click the dropdown menu, and pick a color. You can pick a custom color as well.

   ![pre-selected](images/pre-selected.PNG)

    *You can choose one of the pre-selected colors.* 

   <br><br>
   ![custom-color](images/custom-color.PNG)

   *Or you can  customize the color precisely.*


3. This change is **immediate**, and does not require a restart.

### 4. Customization FAQs
 
**Q**: I have added the image, but it doesn't appear. <br>

**A**:
* Please check if the image is either **.jpg** or **.png**. Other image types are NOT supported. 
* Please check if you have the correct name format used—refer to **"_Setting a profile picture_" point 3** above. 
* Please check if the image size is too small or too large. Due to the limitations of JavaFX, extreme image sizes cannot be displayed. 

If you have
exhausted all options, you can file a bug report on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/issues).
<br>

You have now learnt to customize nustracker to its fullest. Go ahead and play around with the settings!
    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Misc
### Saving the data

nustracker data is saved in the hard disk automatically after executing any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

The file is saved in a folder where you ran the application. If you ran the application in `C:\Users\JohnDoe`, the data file will be in `C:\Users\JohnDoe\data` and is named `addressbook.json`

### Editing the data file

nustracker data is saved as a JSON file. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

_Please edit carefully! nustracker will start a fresh run if errors are present!_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous nustracker home folder.

**Q**: I noticed a bug in nustracker. How do I report it?<br>
**A**: We are committed to delivering well-made software and to achieve that, every single bug report counts. To submit a
bug report, please visit the **Issues** page [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/issues). Thank you for contributing to nustracker!
