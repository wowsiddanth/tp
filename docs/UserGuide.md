## Getting Started

**You finally have your hands on _*NUSTracker*_. Great! Let's learn how to use it now.**

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `nustracker.jar`, found under [Releases](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases).


3. Copy the `nustracker.jar` to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for NUSTracker.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one shown below should appear in a few seconds. The app already contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)


5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
 
 
   Here are some example commands you can try:

   * **`add n/John Doe m/CS id/e1283011 y/2 p/81231293 e/johndoe@example.com`** : Adds a contact named `John Doe` with the major `CS`,
      student ID `e1283011`, year `2`, phone number `81231293`, and email `johndoe@example.com` to NUSTracker.
   
   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.


6. For a full and comprehensive overview of each command, refer to the [Features](#features) section!

**Now, you are ready for an unprecedented overhaul in student and event management using NUSTracker!**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

NUSTracker was designed to help the average overworked university student, who also has many important responsibilities outside the curriculum
in clubs and societies—specifically **student and event management**.


### What can NUSTracker do?
1. **Keep track of students**

    NUSTracker displays all students currently associated with the organization neatly. The students have their details, 
   and a profile picture (optional) listed with them as well, allowing quick and convenient access to student particulars.


2. **Keep tracks of events and event _attendance_**

    NUSTracker can also display the events stored, their information, and the participants taking part in those events.


4. **Keep track of event blacklists**
    
    Events often have blacklists, which can also be tracked within NUSTracker.


5. **Be customized to the user's liking**
    
    One of the key points of NUSTracker is its customization. For more information, see [Customization](#customization).


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [m/MAJOR]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/CS` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[y/YEAR]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `y/1`, `y/ 1 2 3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Customization

Another key feature of NUSTracker is its ability to be customized greatly. This section covers how NUSTracker can be
customized to your liking.

### 1. Changing between Light/Dark Theme
NUSTracker has a light/dark theme. To toggle between the two, click the button (to the left of **Settings**) as shown in the image below and
voila!
 
![change_theme](images/change_theme.PNG)

### 2. Setting a profile picture
NUSTracker has the ability to add a profile picture to a student. Follow the steps given to add a picture:
1. If you have not started NUSTracker before, run NUSTracker within a folder of your choice.


2. Once it runs, a folder called _**profile-pictures**_ is created within the folder that contains NUSTracker.

    ![profile-pictures-folder](images/profile-pictures-folder.PNG)

    *The **profile-pictures** folder is highlighted in blue*
<br><br>
3. Open the _**profile-pictures**_ folder and add the image you want as a profile picture. The image must be either a **.png** or a **.jpg** image.
   <br><br>

   1. Rename the image to correspond to the **Student ID** of the student in NUSTracker that will use this profile picture.

       For example, let's say there is a student in NUSTracker with the Student ID **e1111111**.

      ![match-student-id](images/match-student-id.PNG)
 
      ![changed-profile-picture](images/changed-profile-picture.PNG)

      *The updated student card (belonging to student with Student ID **e1111111** in NUSTracker)*
      <br><br>
   3. The image will update once you **click the Refresh button or restart NUSTracker**.
   4. You're done!

### 3. Changing the _glow_ of the profile picture border

NUSTracker allows you to change the color of the glow of the profile picture.

1. Open up the **Settings** window either by clicking the **Settings** button or by typing in `settings` into the command box.
 

2. Click the dropdown menu, and pick a color. You can pick a custom color as well.

   ![pre-selected](images/pre-selected.PNG)

    *You can choose one of the pre-selected colors.* 

   <br><br>
   ![custom-color](images/custom-color.PNG)

   *Or you can  customize the color precisely.*


3. This change is **immediate**, and does not require a restart.

### 4. Customization FAQs
 
**Q**: I have added the image, but it doesn't appear. <br>

**A**:
* Please check if the image is either **.jpg** or **.png**. Other image types are NOT supported. 
* Please check if you have the correct name format used—refer to **"_Setting a profile picture_" point 3** above. 
* Please check if the image size is too small or too large. Due to the limitations of JavaFX, extreme image sizes cannot be displayed. 

If you have
exhausted all options, you can file a bug report on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/issues).
<br>

You have now learnt to customize NUSTracker to its fullest. Go ahead and play around with the settings!
    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Misc
### Saving the data

NUSTracker data is saved in the hard disk automatically after executing any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NUSTracker data is saved as a JSON file. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

_Please edit carefully! NUSTracker will start a fresh run if errors are present!_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NUSTracker home folder.

**Q**: I noticed a bug in NUSTracker. How do I report it?<br>
**A**: We are committed to delivering well-made software and to achieve that, every single bug report counts. To submit a
bug report, please visit the **Issues** page [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/issues). Thank you for contributing to NUSTracker!
