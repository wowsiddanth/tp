**nustracker** is a desktop application for NUS event directors and student leaders of student organizations in NUS School of Computing to manage students and events.

As an event director and student leader, you will be able to add students and events into **nustracker** and use it to keep track event attendance, blacklist students, etc. These are just _some_ of the features and there will be more to come in the future. **nustracker** is customized to your needs—simple, intuitive, and easy to pick up.

All these things can be done through a simple and intuitive Command Line Interface (CLI), whilst being complimented by a detailed and elegant interface. 

This document will guide you through on how to start using **nustracker**.

You might see text formatted within colored boxes, so here's a quick run-through what they mean:

## Getting Started

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:** <br><br>

**For macOS users**: Please start the .jar file via the terminal (see: step 5 below). If you do not, the files may not be created due to 
current macOS security restrictions on file creation. <br><br>
**For Windows users**: It is also recommended that the .jar be started
via the terminal as well (but double-clicking should work fine).

</div>

<br> 

**You finally have your hands on nustracker. Great! Let's learn how to use it now.**<br>

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer. 

2. Download the latest `nustracker.zip`, found under [Releases](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases). 

3. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice. We recommended something easy to type, like `myfolder`.

4. For Windows Users (**macOS users see Step 5**)
    1. Double-click the jar file.<br><br>

5. For macOS Users: 
   1. Open [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac).
   2. Navigate to the home folder created in **Step 3** using the terminal. For example, if your folder was created in Desktop and is called **myfolder**,
      you would type `cd /Desktop/myfolder/` to move to that folder. For more information, check: [_Go to a folder by entering its pathname_.](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/mac-help/mchlp1236/mac)
   3. Type the following command into the Terminal: `java -jar [CS2103T-T11-1][nustracker].jar`.

Get ready for an unprecedented overhaul in student and event management using **nustracker**!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

**nustracker** was designed to help the average overworked university student, who also has many important responsibilities outside the curriculum in clubs and societies—specifically **student and event management**.

### What can nustracker do?
1. **Keep track of students**

    **nustracker** displays all students currently associated with the organization neatly. The students have their details and a profile picture (optional) listed with them as well, allowing quick and convenient access to student particulars.


2. **Keep tracks of events and event _attendance_**

    **nustracker** can also display the events stored, their information, and the participants taking part in those events.


4. **Keep track of event blacklists**
    
    Events often have blacklists, which can also be managed using **nustracker**.


5. **Be customized to the user's liking**
    
    One of the key points of **nustracker** is its customization. For more information, see [Customization](#customization).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basics of nustracker

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :label:
The profile pictures shown here are provided with the .zip file! You can add them to the profile-pictures folder (see Customization for more information), or you can ignore them for now.
</div>

We hope you are excited to learn the basics of **nustracker**!
But, before we do anything, let’s set the premise. Imagine that you are the manpower executive of a newly-formed NUS society called the Imaginary Society (Very creative we know). 

It plans on holding a fair—appropriately titled the Imaginary Fair—on the 1st of December 2021, at 9am.

Here are the particulars of our first member and participant: <br><br>
**Name**: Sae Byeok <br> <img style="float: right;" height="140" width="140" alt="" src="images/user-guide/sae-byeok.gif"/>
**Phone number**: 87438007 <br>
**Major**: CS <br>
**Year**: 1 <br>
**Student ID**: e1111111 <br>
**Email**: saebyeok@example.com <br>
**Wants to join**: Imaginary Fair

### Adding your first student

Okay, now that we know who our first member is, let's add her as a student to **nustracker**.

To add her, we are going to use the `add` command, which follows the format:
` add n/STUDENT_NAME m/MAJOR id/STUDENT_ID y/YEAR p/PHONE e/EMAIL`

So, in the case of Sae Byeok, her fields would be:
- `STUDENT_NAME`: Sae Byeok
- `MAJOR`: CS
- `STUDENT_ID`: e1111111
- `YEAR`: 1
- `PHONE`: 87438007
- `EMAIL`: saebyeok@example.com

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The fields do not have to be any specific order. For example, `MAJOR` can come before `STUDENT_NAME`.
</div>

Using the fields above, type this into the command box: `add n/Sae Byeok m/CS id/e1111111 y/1 p/87438007 e/saebyeok@example.com` and press **Enter**.

After entering the command and pressing **Enter**, scroll all the way down using the scrollbar on the right to view your newly added student!
**nustracker** should look like this: 

![added-first-student](images/user-guide/add-student-aft-press-enter.png)

Congratulations! You have just added your first student! Next, we will learn how to create an event and 
eventually, how to add Sae Byeok as a participant!

### Creating your first event

Let's create the event `Imaginary Fair` to contain information about the Fair that the Imaginary Society wants to organise.

To create this event, we are going to use the `create` command, which follows the format: `create n/EVENT_NAME d/EVENT_DATE t/EVENT_TIME`.

So, in the case of Imaginary Fair, the fields would be:
- `EVENT_NAME`: Imaginary Fair
- `EVENT_DATE (DD-MM-YYYY)`: 01-12-2021
- `EVENT_TIME (24 Hour Time)`: 0900

Using the fields above, type this into the command box: `create n/Imaginary Fair d/01-12-2021 t/0900` and press **Enter**.

Now lets view the newly created event! To make **nustracker** show the current list of events, either press the **Events** button in the top bar, or type `events` into the command box and press **Enter**.
(_If you are unsure about the buttons, refer [here](#general-layout)._) Then scroll down using the scrollbar on the right.

If done right, **nustracker** should look like this: 

![created-event](images/user-guide/after-creating-event.png)

Congratulations! You have now created an event in **nustracker** as well!

### Enrolling your first student into your first event

Previously, you had added Sae Byeok as a student, and created the _Imaginary Fair_ event. 
Let's enroll her into the _Imaginary Fair_ as a participant.

In order to do this, we will make use of the `enroll` command: `enroll id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT`.

So, in the case of Sae Byeok and the Imaginary Fair, it would be:
- `STUDENT_ID`: e1111111 
- `EVENT`: Imaginary Fair

Using the fields above, type this into the command box: `enroll id/e1111111 ev/Imaginary Fair` and press **Enter**.

If done correctly, this change should be reflected in both the Imaginary Fair's details and Sae Byeok's particulars.

![event-card](images/user-guide/imaginary-fair-event-card-after-enroll.png)
_Under Participants, there is a participant with the Student ID `e111111`, which corresponds to Sae Byeok_

To make **nustracker** go back to the students list, either press the **Students** button in the top bar, or type `students` into the command box and press **Enter**.

![student-card](images/user-guide/student-card-after-enroll.png)<br>
_Under Enrolled Events, we can see that Sae Byeok is enrolled in the Imaginary Fair_ <br>




**Congratulations!** You have reached the end of this very brief tutorial where you learnt how to add your first student, create your
first event, as well as enrolling students into an event! But remember, **nustracker** is much more powerful than this!

You can:
- Edit Sae Byeok's details
- Delete events
- Blacklist students
- Export the emails of a list of students
- Add profile pictures
- And much _much_ more!

For a more comprehensive list of commands, please refer to the sections below or take a look at the [Command summary](#command-summary).

You're on your way to becoming an **nustracker** pro!

----------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## Commands Section

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:label: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [m/MAJOR]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/CS` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[y/YEAR]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `y/1`, `y/ 1 2 3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `students`, `events`, and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Commands that take in parameters cannot contain extraneous prefixes nor slashes. This means none of the input parameters should contain any slashes, since slashes are used to identify prefixes.

* If a command is entered with the correct prefixes but multiple inputs to the prefixes are not accepted,
  the error message shown would be based on the leftmost invalid prefix parameter in the command's command format.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:label: **Note:** The command for deleting students and events are both `delete`.<br>
However, `delete` will delete either a student or an event and **cannot contain both student and event prefixes at once**.<br>
i.e. `delete id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT_NAME` is not allowed. (Refer to [Deleting an event](#deleting-an-event--delete) for more information.)

</div>

### Filtering students: `filter`

Filters students whose data contains the given field.

Command: `filter [id/STUDENT_ID [MORE_STUDENT_IDs]...] [n/STUDENT_NAME [MORE_STUDENT_NAMES]...] [m/MAJOR [MORE_MAJORS]...] [y/YEAR [MORE_YEARS]...] [ev/EVENT_NAME]`

* You can filter by:
    - Multiple student IDs.
    - Multiple student names.
    - Multiple majors.
    - Multiple years.
    - **A single** event name.

* This command can only be used when **nustracker** is showing the Student list.
* You can only filter by one field (i.e. filter only by student ID, student name, year, major, or event name).
* You have to filter by at least 1 parameter (simply typing `filter` will not work)
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `n/john` will match with `n/JOHN`.
* You can search using multiple keywords except for events.
* You can search by partial keywords for names. e.g. `n/al` will match with `n/alice`

Examples:
* `filter id/e1234567` returns the student with the ID e1234567 if that student exists in nustracker.
* `filter id/e1234567 e2345678` returns two students whose student IDs are e1234567 and e2345678 if they exist in nustracker.

_**Coming soon:** Filter by phone number._

_**Coming soon:** Filter by multiple fields._

### Delete shown students : `delfiltered`

Mass deletes all students currently shown in the student list. This is typically used after a filter
command to delete students based on a certain criteria.

Command: `delfiltered`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Use with caution! If the student list is not filtered before using `delfiltered`, all the students currently in **nustracker** will be deleted since all of them are shown.
</div>

* This command can only be used when **nustracker** is showing the Student list.
* After all the filtered students are deleted, the remaining students would then all be shown in the list, if any.
* At least one student needs to be shown in the filtered list for `delfiltered` to work.

Examples:
* `filter y/4` followed by `delfiltered` will delete all students who are in Year 4.
* `filter ev/Graduation 2021` followed by `delfiltered` will delete all students that have attended the Graduation Ceremony in 2021.

### Blacklisting students: `blacklist`

Blacklists students from an event. Blacklisted Students will not be allowed to enroll into the events they are blacklisted from.

Command: `blacklist id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Student ID need not exist in the database.
* Event name has to exist in the database.
* Student ID cannot be enrolled in event.
  * Use the [remove](#removing-a-student-from-an-event--remove) command to un-enroll the student ID before running the `blacklist` command.

Examples:
* `blacklist id/e1234567 ev/Orientation Camp` blacklists the student ID e1234567 from the Orientation Camp event.
* `blacklist id/e0000000 ev/Sports Camp` blacklists the student ID e0000000 from the Sports Camp event.
 
### Whitelisting students: `whitelist`

Whitelists students from an event. Whitelisted students are removed from an event's blacklist.

Command: `whitelist id/STUDENT_ID ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Student ID needs to be in the event's blacklist.
* Event name has to exist in the database.

Examples:
* `whitelist id/e1234567 ev/Orientation Camp` removes the student ID e1234567 from the Orientation Camp event's blacklist.
* `whitelist id/e0000000 ev/Sports Camp` removes the student ID e0000000 from the Sports Camp event's blacklist.

## Customization

1. [Changing between Light/Dark theme](#changing-between-lightdark-theme)
2. [Setting a profile picture](#setting-a-profile-picture)
3. [Changing the glow of the profile picture](#changing-the-glow-of-the-profile-picture-border)

Another key feature of **nustracker** is its ability to be customized greatly. This section covers how **nustracker** can be
customized to your liking.

### Changing between Light/Dark Theme
**nustracker** has a light/dark theme. To toggle between the two, click the button (to the left of _**Settings**_) as shown in the image below and voila!
 
![change_theme](images/user-guide/change_theme.PNG)

### Setting a profile picture
**nustracker** has the ability to add a profile picture to a student. Follow the steps given to add a picture:

1. If you have not started **nustracker** before, run **nustracker** within a folder of your choice.

2. Once it runs, a folder called _**profile-pictures**_ is created within the folder that contains **nustracker**.

    ![profile-pictures-folder](images/user-guide/profile-pictures-folder.PNG)

    *The **profile-pictures** folder is highlighted in blue*

3. Open the _**profile-pictures**_ folder and add the image you want as a profile picture. The image must be either a **.png** or a **.jpg** image.

4. Rename the image to correspond to the **Student ID** of the student in **nustracker** that will use this profile picture.

    For example, let's say there is a student in **nustracker** with the Student ID **e1111111**.

   ![match-student-id](images/user-guide/match-student-id.PNG)
 
   ![changed-profile-picture](images/user-guide/changed-profile-picture.PNG)

      *The updated student card (belonging to student with Student ID **e1111111** in **nustracker**)*

5. The profile picture will update once you type `refresh` into the command box, click the Refresh button, or restart **nustracker**.

6. You're done!

  Although most image sizes will work perfectly fine, the best image sizes are 120px by 120px.

### Changing the glow of the profile picture border

**nustracker** allows you to change the color of the glow of the profile picture.

1. Open up the **Settings** window either by clicking the **Settings** button or by typing in `settings` into the command box.
 

2. Click the dropdown menu, and pick a color.

   ![pre-selected](images/user-guide/pre-selected.PNG)

    *You can choose one of the pre-selected colors.*
 
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Advanced users: You can manually input your own color hex code in preferences.json! (If it is incorrect,
the glow will be the default pink!).
</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Customization FAQs
 
**Q**: I have added the image, but it doesn't appear. <br>

**A**: Please check if:  
* the image is either **.jpg** or **.png**. Other image types are NOT supported. 
* you have the correct name format used—refer to [Setting a profile picture](#setting-a-profile-picture) point 3 above. 
* the image size is too small or too large. Due to the limitations of JavaFX, extreme image sizes cannot be displayed (more than 10 mb). 

If you have exhausted all options, you can file a bug report on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/issues).
<br>

You have now learnt to customize **nustracker** to its fullest. Go ahead and play around with the settings!

## Misc
### Saving the data

**nustracker** data is saved in the hard disk automatically after executing any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

The file is saved in a folder where you ran the application. If you ran the application in `C:\Users\JohnDoe`, the data file will be in `C:\Users\JohnDoe\data` and is named `addressbook.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:label: **Note:**
The folder `C:\Users\JohnDoe\data` is also where exported files are contained!

</div>

### Editing the data file

**nustracker** data is saved as a JSON file. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger"> :exclamation: **Caution:**
Please edit carefully! **nustracker** will not be able to load your data if any errors are present. If you type a command while the application has no data, your own data will be overwritten. 
We recommend that you make a backup of your original data file first just in case.
